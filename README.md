# Forum REST API Project
## Overview
This project is a hands-on endeavor as I delve into self-learning the Spring framework and backend Java development. The primary goal is to gain practical experience and proficiency in these technologies. The project involves building a Forum REST API using Java, implemented with Spring Boot and secured through Spring Security with JWT token authentication. The backend seamlessly integrates with a MySQL database using Spring Data and Hibernate for efficient data management.

## Key Features
- Java & Spring Boot: Utilizing the power of Java and the flexibility of Spring Boot for rapid development.

- Security: Ensuring secure user interactions with Spring Security and JWT token authentication.

- Data Management: Leveraging Spring Data and Hibernate for seamless integration with a MySQL database.

- Testing: Rigorous unit testing and integration testing methodologies for code reliability.

## Future Plans
Looking ahead, the project is poised for expansion. There are plans to incorporate a dynamic front end using ReactJS in the coming months, providing a comprehensive and user-friendly experience.
